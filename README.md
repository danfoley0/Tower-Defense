Changes in this project:
Made the map, using a TileMap and TileSet
Made the turrets, trying to be able to place them with a mouse click
Got them to appear on a mouse click
Put in a collision on the path so turrets can't be spawned there
Created scenes for the enemy and the bullets
Created upgrade system for turret, can now go to level 2 or 3
Created Path2D and PathFollow2D to make the enemy follow the path
Tried to make the bullet shoot, couldn't figure it out
Tried to make the turret look at the enemy, it can't detect it for some reason, I'm not sure why
Ran out of time with the project, hopefully I can work more on it after break once Mr. Lemke is back
